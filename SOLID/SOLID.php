# SOLID Introduction Acronym 

// SOLID principles are the design principles that enable us manage most of the software design problems

// The term SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable 

// The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by Robert C Martin

# If we don't follow SOLID Principles 

// End up with tight or strong coupling of the code with many other modules/applications
// Tight coupling caused time to implement any new requirement features or any bug fixes and some times it created unknowns issues
// End up with a code which is not testable
// End up with duplication of code 
// End up creating new bugs by fixing another bug
// End up with many unknown issues in the application development cycle.


# If we follow SOLID principles 

// Achieve reduction on complexity of code 
// Increase readability, extensibility and maintenance 
// Reduce error and implement Reusability
// Achieve Better Testability 
// Reduce tight coupling
